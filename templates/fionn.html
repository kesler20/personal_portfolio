            <p>
            As part of the GEC week we were asked to develop a solution for reducing pollution in 
            Johannesburg, South Africa 
            As drinking water in Johannesburg is contaminated with microplastics, we decided to 
            implement Fionn Ferreiraâ€™s magnetic separation and scale up the process designing a separation unit.

            <h3 class="md">Method</h3>
            <p>The seperation method was first introduced by a physicist called Arden Warner 
                who came up with a way to remove oil spills by magnetizing the fluid. 
                Our solution focused for a smaller scaled implementation first as was designed to purify
                drinking water that was going into public fountains.
                The separators implemented a PID controller that regulates the inflow of 
                ferrofluids, contaminated water and the outflow. The PID controller would be connected to a probe that would measure the level of contamination of the drinking water.
                Our seperation implemented a stirrer that would magnetise to attract the 
                ferrofluids and microplastics migrated to the nonpolar phase.

            <h3 class="md">Solution</h3>
            <p>The following seperator removes microplastics from water using a liquid ferro fluid.
            Once the ferro fluid is added the microplastics will migrate to the oil phase that will be attracted 
            to one side of the seperator using a magnet
            The water will be extracted from the other side of the magnet and recycled untill the desired purity is achieved</p>

                The purity level is measured by the probe that was designed to take pictures of water 
                samples to send to a computer to calculate the number of contaminants using Adobe Photoshop
